Introduction 

Overview 

The Statement Extract (MM_STMXT) batch application generates an extract file with 
comprehensive information for statements. In addition to standard statement information, 
the MM_STMXT produces information for new accounts, additional credit line and 
allotment information in the Loan Account Summary record, and master line sub loan 
records. The extract is comprised of several fixed length record types for ease of 
printing. 

Variables located under the following calculation types control the type of information 
included in the extract: 

• Statement 
• Statement Processing 
• Loan Bill 
• Required Available Balance 
• Avg Neg Collected Balance Service Charge 
• Negative Amortization 


These variables are described in the Variables Used with MM_STMXT section of this 
document. 

Detailed information on running the report, including its parameters, is included in the 
Statement Extract (MM_STMXT) Report section of this document. 

The output is described in the Statement Extract (MM_STMXT) Record Layouts section 
of this document. 

Post-Process Report for Dodd-Frank Accounts 

The Statement Extract with Dodd-Frank Bill Records (MM_STMXT_DFBILLRECS) 
report generates an extract file to provide additional records containing the information 
required in statements as a result of the Dodd-Frank Act and CFPB rules. This report is 
run as a post-process of MM_STMXT and provides the information for loans in 
product(s) with the Dodd Frank Mortgage Indicator (DFMI) variable set to Y. 

Detailed information on running the report, including its parameters, is included in the 
Statement Extract with Dodd-Frank Bill Records (MM_STMXT_DFBILLRECS) Report 
section of this document.

Notes: 

• Inclusion of the following records is based on variable settings: 1008, 1500, 2255, 
2260, 3000, 3050, 3100, 3200, 3300, and 3500. Refer to the Variables Used with 
MM_STMXT section for more information. 
• The 1050, 1055, and 1060 records are included only when the Branch Addressing 
YN (BRAD) parameter = Y. 
• The 4175 and 4575 records are included only when the Reg Z Open End Credit 
Product (RZOE) variable = Y and the Loan Activity Section Type (ACTP) variable = 
5. 



Transaction Reporting Groups 

The following transaction reporting groups control the transactions included in the 
MM_STMXT extract file output. 

• STMT - Controls the transactions used for imaging 
• STM2 - Controls the transactions used for transaction activity 
• STX1 - Controls the transactions used to determine the amount of a loan advance 
• ANLY - Controls the transactions counted when determining the account analysis 
summaries 


Transactions can be linked to each transaction reporting group in the RtxnRptGrp 
system table using the procedure in the "RtxnRptGrp (Transaction Reporting Group or 
Rtxn Report Group)" DNA help topic. 

Service Charge vs. Relational Pricing 

The service charge information included in the MM_STMXT extract file is based on the 
method the institution uses to generate service charges. If the institution uses relational 
pricing, service charges and reversals (waived amounts) are shown separately. For 
institutions using service charging functionality, the service charge amount in the report 
is the net value. 

Cycle Changes 

A cycle may be changed at any time. If the IMMEDIATE CYCLE CHANGE checkbox is 
selected on the Cycles screen, MM_STMXT applies the new cycle immediately. 

Statement Delivery Code User Field 

If a statement delivery code is specified at the person or organization level through the 
Statement Delivery Code user field, the value is included in the New Account (0001) 
Record of MM_STMXT. Setting a delivery code value in the Statement Delivery Code 
user field at the person or organization level affects all accounts where the person or 
organization is the Tax Reported For owner. If the Statement Delivery Code user field is 
blank, the delivery method set on the Cycles screen at the account level is used. If both 
the Statement Delivery Code user field is blank and no delivery method is set on the 
Cycles screen at the account level, the delivery method is determined by your print 
vendor. 

The institution must create the Statement Delivery Code user field using the standard 
procedures for establishing institution-defined user fields. Refer to the “User Fields” help 
topic for detailed instructions. The user field code for the Statement Delivery Code user 
field must be STDL, and the user field must be set to display at the person and 
organization level. The delivery code value specified through the Statement Delivery 
Code (STDL) user field cannot exceed four characters. For consistency between the 
Statement Delivery Code user field values and the delivery methods used for cycles, the 
STDL user field values should mirror the codes set up in the Delivery Method business 
table. 

Note: STDL user field values are used for third-party vendor purposes only and are not 
used within the DNA system. 


MM_STMXT and Reg E Statements 

The default setting for the ACCOUNT CYCLES REQUIRED checkbox on the Application 
Manager screen for the MM_STMXT batch application is selected. With the ACCOUNT 
CYCLES REQUIRED checkbox selected, the system requires an account cycle to be 
specified when running the report. However, Reg E statements do not use cycles; when 
running MM_STMXT for Reg E statements, the ACCOUNT CYCLES REQUIRED checkbox 
must be cleared. 

To clear the checkbox, navigate to System > Institution > Applications and follow the 
steps below. 

1. On the Application Manager screen, 
a. Select Batch Executable from the APPLICATION TYPE dropdown list. 
b. The screen refreshes and the applications display in the Applications grid. 
c. Select Statement Extract (MM_STMXT) from the Applications grid and click 
Edit. 
d. The Edit Application tab populates. 







2. On the Edit Application tab, 
a. Clear the ACCOUNT CYCLE REQUIRED checkbox, indicating that account cycles 
are not required. 
b. Click Process. 




3. To return to the previous screen (if not displayed), click Close. 


Caution! No warning is raised if the ACCOUNT CYCLE REQUIRED checkbox is not selected 
for a batch job that typically uses cycles, and cycles are not linked to the application for 
the standard runs. Therefore, when running MM_STMXT for statements that use cycles, 
the institution must ensure cycles are linked to the MM_STMXT application prior to 
running the batch job. 

 


Variables Used with MM_STMXT 

Overview 

The information included in the MM_STMXT extract file is based on the values for the 
variables associated with the MM_STMXT batch application. Some of the variables are 
set at the system level and others at the product level. These variables are described in 
this section. Refer to the “System Level Variables” and the “Product Level Variables” 
DNA help topics for detailed instructions on setting variables. 

Overrides 

The following tables indicate which system-level variables can be overridden at the 
product level. A product-level variable value can be overridden at the account level if the

Statement Extract (MM_STMXT) Report 

Description 

The Statement Extract (MM_STMXT) batch application produces an extract file with 
comprehensive account information including information for new accounts, additional 
credit line and allotment information in the Loan Account Summary record, and master 
line sub-loan records. The report is broken into fixed length record types for ease of 
printing. 

Variables under several different calculation types control the type of information 
included in the report. The variables are described in the Variables Used with 
MM_STMXT section of this document. 

The output is described in the Statement Extract (MM_STMXT) Record Layouts section 
of this document. 

Service Charge Information 

The service charge information included in the MM_STMXT extract file is based on the 
method the institution uses to generate service charges. If the institution uses relational 
pricing, service charges and reversals (waived amounts) are shown separately. For 
institutions using service charging functionality, the service charge amount is the net 
value.
